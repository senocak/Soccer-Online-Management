## Soccer online manager game API

* You need to write an API for a simple application where football/soccer fans will create fantasy teams and will be able to sell or buy players.
* User must be able to create an account and log in using the API.
* Each user can have only one team (user is identified by an email)
* When the user is signed up, they should get a team of 20 players (the system should generate players):
  * 3 goalkeepers
  * 6 defenders
  * 6 midfielders
  * 5 attackers

* Each player has an initial value of $1.000.000.
* Each team has an additional $5.000.000 to buy other players.
* When logged in, a user can see their team and player information

* Team has the following information:
  * Team name, and a country (can be edited)
  * Team value (sum of player values)

* Player has the following information
  * First name, last name, country (can be edited by a team owner)
  * Age (random number from 18 to 40) and market value

* A team owner can set the player on a transfer list
* When a user places a player on a transfer list, they must set the asking price/value for this player. This value should be listed on a market list. When another user/team buys this player, they must be bought for this price.
* Each user should be able to see all players on a transfer list and filter them by country, team name, player name, and a value.
* With each transfer, team budgets are updated.
* When a player is transferred to another team, their value should be increased between 10 and 100 per cent. Implement a random factor for this purpose.

### Implement administrator role.
* An administrator who can CRUD users, teams, players, add new players to the market or in the team and change all player/team information, including playerâ€™s value
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user and admin actions via the API, including authentication.
* In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
* Write unit and e2e tests.

### Conclusion
* Total tests: **185**
* Code coverage:
  * Classes: **95.5%**
  * Method: **93.9%**
  * Line: **86%**
